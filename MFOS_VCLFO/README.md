Kosmo format front panel for the Music From Outer Space VC LFO synth module.

There are two versions. One is for the MFOS board built unmodified. The other is for a build that incorporates [this sync mod](https://electro-music.com/forum/post-387749.html#387749). It can be built on an auxiliary board with two wires connecting to the MFOS board. Mount both boards using a bracket attached with pots.
